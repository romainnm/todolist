## Assignment
- Create a todo app

### Requirements:
- The app is separated as such that:
    - We can create different project
    - Each project can have multiple todolist
    - Then we can add tasks to a todolist
- At a minimum a task should have a title, description, dueDate and priority
- Store the datas locally with localStorage

## Learning outcomes from this project
- It's been really interesting to create and manipulate objects with nested arrays/objects
- Learning how to use LocalStorage


## How this project can be optimized
- Add ability to edit tasks
- Add functions to delete projects/todolists
